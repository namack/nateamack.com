Unfortunately, this is not the case. The reality is that these are just two different ways to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> into your file.</p>\n<h2>Why do we need to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> anyway?</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed that even though you need to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code>, you don‚Äôt actually use it anywhere in your file. Usually, it is bad practice to leave unused variables sitting around in a file and your linter should complain. This is not the case for <code class=\"language-text\">React</code>, however, since JSX requires it to be in scope. Eventually though, you won‚Äôt have to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> at all for your JSX to know what is going on. You‚Äôll only have to import the parts of React that you actually need, like hooks, context, and types (üòè). In fact, Ember has already dropped the requirement for importing <code class=\"language-text\">Ember</code> as of <a href=\"%5Bhttps://www.emberjs.com/blog/2017/10/11/ember-2-16-released.html%5D(https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2017/10/11/ember-2-16-released.html)\">Ember 2.16</a>.</p>\n<h2>Which one should you use?</h2>\n<p>At this point in time, it doesn‚Äôt matter. <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> just needs to be in scope for JSX to render correctly. How you get it there is up to you: it is a stylistic choice. That being said, consistency is more important than style, so just be consistent throughout a project.</p>\n<p>If you do end up importing all of React‚Äôs exports into the <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> namespace using <code class=\"language-text\">import * as React from ‚Äòreact‚Äô</code>, you won‚Äôt be able to use any more named imports in the file. This is because everything has already been exported - just into the <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> namespace. This is also technically the case when you import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> as the default import using <code class=\"language-text\">import React from ‚Äòreact‚Äô</code>. You are able to use anything in the namespace, like <code class=\"language-text\">React.useState</code>. Personally, I prefer to use named imports to reduce the need for prepending everything with <code class=\"language-text\">React.</code>. Then, when we don‚Äôt need to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> at all, it will be easy to update using a simple find and replace.</p>\n<p>The ability to import <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> as the default export is really just an illusion by Babel to make things look nice. Without it, we would <strong>have</strong> to write <code class=\"language-text\">import * as React from ‚Äòreact‚Äô</code> Everywhere and we wouldn‚Äôt have a choice. So make a choice and stick with it - at least on a per project basis.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Importing React","date":"February 19, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":null}}
