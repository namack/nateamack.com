## The Problem

Congratulations, you have just setup [Cypress](https://cypress.io) to run your integration and end-to-end tests for your single page app ðŸŽ‰. All the tests run locally using `cypress open` and you have even setup a yarn script to run your tests in a continuous integration environment with `cypress run`. After setting up your initial `.circleci/config.yaml` file, you run into a few walls and hit a few dead ends ðŸ˜£.

This was certainly the case for me, and unfortunately, there are a host of variables that might contribute to these issues. This is because Cypress relies on some system requirements that you likely already had installed on your local machine, but may not be installed on the CI server. Luckily, Cypress knew this could be an issue so they maintain a few different [Docker images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images) to be used for this purpose. There are also different assumptions made by each Docker image involved regarding the root working directory and where the `.cache` directory lives. The following setup will help eliminate those variables to allow you to have a working Cypress/CircleCI test setup.


## The Solution

Here are the jobs required to build and test a single page app in CircleCI. They are broken out into separate jobs because there would typically be other steps, like unit testing, that can be run in parallel.

#### 1. Download Application Dependencies

```yaml
detect_changes:
  docker:
    - image: circleci/node:latest

  steps:
    - checkout

    - restore_cache:
        keys:
          - application-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
          - application-v1-

    - run:
        name: Install Dependencies
        command: yarn install

    - save_cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules
          - ~/.cache
        key: application-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
```

#### 2. Build the Application

```yaml
build_application:
  docker:
    - image: circleci/node:latest

  steps:
    - checkout

  - attach_workspace:
      at: ~/app

  - restore_cache:
      keys:
        - application-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
        - application-v1-

  - run:
      name: Build Application
      command: yarn build

  - persist_to_workspace:
      root: ./
      paths:
        - build
```

#### 3. Run Integration Tests

```yaml
run_integration_test:
  docker:
    - image: cypress/browsers:latest

  working_directory: /home/circleci/app

  steps:
    - checkout

  - attach_workspace:
      at: /home/cricleci/app

  - restore_cache:
      keys:
        - application-v1-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
        - application-v1-

  - run:
      name: Link Cypress Binary
      command: ln -s /home/circleci/.cache ~/.cache

  - run:
      name: Run Acceptance Tests
      command: yarn test:integration

```

It is important to list the images used in each step, because this is where a lot of assumptions between different images start to cause problems. You'll definitely want to use the Cypress Docker Image (`cypress/browsers:latest`) to ensure Cypress has everything it needs to be able to run on its own.

## The Setup

#### Image Working Directories

As previously mentioned, the root working directories for both images needed to build the application (`circleci/node:latest`) and to run the integration tests (`cypress/browsers:latest` are different.

**`circleci/node:latest`**

*Default Working Directory*: `/home/circleci/`

**`cypress/browsers:latest`**

*Default Working Directory*: `/root/`

This will cause issues when trying to access your cached `node_modules` from the first build job (`detect_changes`) and when trying to access the `build` directory persisted in the second step (`build_application`). To fix this, we must change the working directory of the Cypress image to be the same as the other `circleci/node:latest` images.

```yaml
working_directory: /home/circleci/app
{...}
      - attach_workspace:
          at: /home/circleci/app
```

#### Cached Cypress

At this point, the integration tests should *almost* run. We have the `/build` and `/node_modules` directories successfully copied over to our Cypress image, but the tests will fail because they can't find the `.cache` directory.

```bash
Cypress executable not found at: /root/.cache/Cypress/3.0.1/Cypress/Cypress
```

Once again the differing assumptions made by the two images causes this problem. The `circleci/node:latest` image puts the cache in `/home/circleci/.cache`, but the `cypress/browsers:latest` image expects the folder to be in `/root/.cache`. To fix this, we simply set a syamlink to point Cypress to the correct directory:

```yaml
  - run:
      name: Link Cypress Binary
      command: ln -s /home/circleci/.cache ~/.cache
```

## Success!

Now Cypress should be running in CircleCI - hopefully all your tests pass ðŸ˜†! Since there are so many things that need to be lined up in order for these images to work together, it is worth a recap:

- Use the Cypress Docker image
  - Cypress needs a lot of system dependencies (taken care with the [Docker image](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images))
- Resolve the differences in root working directories
  - Change the working directory of the Cypress image to `/home/circleci/app`
- Syamlink the `.cache` directory so Cypress can find it
  - `ln -s /home/circleci/.cache ~/.cache`
